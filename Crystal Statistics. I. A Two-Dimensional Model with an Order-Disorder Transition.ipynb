    "# Crystal Statistics. I. A Two-Dimensional Model with an Order-Disorder Transition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper \"Crystal Statistics. I. A Two-Dimensional Model with an Order-Disorder Transition\" by Lars Onsager, published in Physical Review in 1944, presents a significant contribution to the field of statistical mechanics, specifically focusing on the two-dimensional Ising model. This model is used to describe ferromagnetism in statistical physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, Onsager computed the partition function of the two-dimensional Ising model for the case of zero external magnetic field. He rigorously solved the eigenvalue problem for a long strip of a finite-width crystal, effectively simplifying the problem by joining the strip into a cylindrical shape. This allowed Onsager to use mathematical techniques involving product decompositions and integrals."

    "### Background and Context\n",
    "The study focuses on the Ising model, a mathematical model used to describe ferromagnetism in materials. The Ising model consists of discrete variables called spins that can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). These spins are arranged on a lattice, and each spin interacts with its nearest neighbors. The two-dimensional Ising model, specifically, considers these interactions in a plane, making it a more complex and realistic representation of physical systems compared to the one-dimensional model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "1. **Exact Solution for Zero Field Case**: Onsager provided an exact solution for the partition function of the two-dimensional Ising model in the absence of an external magnetic field. The partition function is crucial because it contains all the thermodynamic information about the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order-Disorder Transition**: Onsager identified the temperature at which an order-disorder phase transition occurs. This critical temperature is the point where the system transitions from a state where spins are aligned (ordered) to one where they are randomly oriented (disordered).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Divergence of Specific Heat**: He demonstrated that at the critical temperature, the specific heat of the system diverges, which is a hallmark of a second-order phase transition. The specific heat describes how the energy of the system changes with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Techniques**: Onsager used advanced mathematical techniques, including product decompositions and integrals, to solve the eigenvalue problem associated with the Ising model. He considered a long strip of finite-width crystal, simplifying the problem by treating it as a cylindrical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Kramers-Wannier Duality**: He employed the Kramers-Wannier duality, a transformation that relates the high-temperature and low-temperature behaviors of the Ising model. This duality provided further validation of the exactness and robustness of his solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Details\n",
    "- **Partition Function**: The partition function $ Z $ for the Ising model without an external field is calculated as follows:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  Z = \\sum_{\\text{all states}} e^{-\\beta E}\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  where $ \\beta = 1/kT$) (with $ k $ being the Boltzmann constant and $ T $ the temperature) and $ E $ is the energy of a particular state.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- **Transfer Matrix Approach**:\n",
    "   - The two-dimensional Ising model can be mapped onto a problem involving a product of transfer matrices.\n",
    "   - Onsager considered a lattice of $ N \\times N $ spins, and defined a transfer matrix $ T $ such that the partition function can be written as:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Z = \\text{Tr}(T^N)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     where $ \\text{Tr} $ denotes the trace of the matrix.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    " - **Eigenvalue Problem**:\n",
    "   - Onsager reduced the problem to finding the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix.\n",
    "   - He showed that the largest eigenvalue $ \\lambda_{\\text{max}} $ of the transfer matrix dominates the partition function in the thermodynamic limit (as $ N \\rightarrow \\infty $).\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "To further understand Onsager's use of transfer matrices in his exact solution for the two-dimensional Ising model, let's break down the key concepts and mathematical framework involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Matrix Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer matrix method is a powerful tool used in statistical mechanics to compute the partition function of lattice models. It transforms the problem into a matrix eigenvalue problem, which can then be solved to obtain thermodynamic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lattice Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Consider a 2D lattice of $N \\times N$ spins.\n",
    "   - Each spin can be either +1 or -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transfer Matrix $ T $**:\n",
    "   - The transfer matrix $ T $ encapsulates the interactions between spins in adjacent rows of the lattice.\n",
    "   - Each element $ T_{ij} $ of the transfer matrix represents the Boltzmann weight of a particular configuration of spins in two adjacent rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partition Function $ Z $**:\n",
    "   - The partition function for the lattice can be expressed as the trace of the \\( N \\)-th power of the transfer matrix:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Z = \\text{Tr}(T^N)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - The trace operation sums over all possible states of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Elements**:\n",
    "   - Define the transfer matrix $ T $ such that each element $ T_{ij} $ is given by:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     T_{ij} = \\exp \\left( K \\sum_{k} \\sigma_k^{(i)} \\sigma_k^{(j)} \\right)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     where $ K = \\frac{J}{k_B T} $ and $ \\sigma_k^{(i)} $ denotes the spin at site $ k $ in row $ i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvalue Problem**:\n",
    "   - The partition function can be dominated by the largest eigenvalue $ \\lambda_{\\text{max}} $ of the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit (large $ N $):\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Z \\approx \\lambda_{\\text{max}}^N\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - This simplifies the problem significantly, as finding the largest eigenvalue is computationally feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Free Energy**:\n",
    "   - The free energy per spin $ f $ is related to the largest eigenvalue:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     f = -k_B T \\ln \\lambda_{\\text{max}}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Critical Temperature**:\n",
    "   - Onsager derived the critical temperature $ T_c $ for the 2D Ising model:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\sinh(2K_c) = 1 \\implies K_c = \\frac{J}{k_B T_c}\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Solving for $ T_c $:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     T_c = \\frac{J}{k_B \\ln(1 + \\sqrt{2})} \\approx 2.269\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Simple 2x2 Lattice\n",
    "\n",
    "For a small $2 \\times 2$ lattice, the transfer matrix $ T $ can be explicitly constructed. Let's illustrate this with a Python code example:\n",

    "I am about halfway the most important part of Onsager's paper, so I'll try to summarize what I've understood so far, I'll edit later when I have more to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Onsager starts by using the 1D model to illustrate his methodology and fix some notations, so I'm gonna follow him but I'll use some more \"modern\" notations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1D Ising model, only neighbouring spins interact, therefore, the energy of interactions is represented by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E=-J\\mu^{(k)}\\mu^{(k-1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J$ is the interaction strength. \n",
    "\n",
    "The partition function is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\sum_{\\mu^{(1)},\\ldots,\\mu^{(N)}=\\pm 1} e^{-\\sum_k J\\mu^{(k)}\\mu^{(k-1)}/kT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Onsager notes that the exponential can be seen as a matrix component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle \\mu^{(k-1)}| V | \\mu^{(k)} \\rangle = e^{-J\\mu^{(k)}\\mu^{(k-1)}/kT}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The partition sum becomes the trace of a matrix product in this notation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\sum_{\\mu^{(1)},\\mu^{(N)}=\\pm 1} \\langle \\mu^{(1)}| V^{N-1} | \\mu^{(N)} \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So for large powers $N$ of $V$, the largest eigenvalue will dominate. In this case, $V$ is just a $2\\times 2$ matrix and the largest eigenvalue is $2\\cosh(J/kT)=2\\cosh(H)$, introducing $H=J/kT$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, to construct the 2D Ising model, Onsager proposes to build it by adding a 1D chain to another 1D chain, and then repeat the procedure to obtain the full 2D model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, he notes that the energy of the newly added chain $\\mu$ will depend on the chain $\\mu'$ to which it is added as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = -\\sum_{j=1}^n J \\mu_j \\mu'_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we exponentiate this to go to the partition formula, we get the $n$th power of the matrixwe defined previously, so using notation that Onsager introduced there\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_1 = (2 \\sinh(2H))^{n/2} \\exp(H^{*}B)$$\n",

    "$$C_j |\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_j,\\ldots,\\mu_n \\rangle = |\\mu_1,\\ldots,-\\mu_j,\\ldots,\\mu_n \\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to account for the energy contribution from spins within a chain, he notes that the total energy is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = -J' \\sum_{j=1}^n \\mu_j\\mu_{j+1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "adding periodicity, that is the $n$th atom is a neighbor to the 1st. Also note that the interaction strength should not be equal to the interchain interaction strength. He introduces new matrix operators $s_j$ which act on a chain as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_j|\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_j,\\ldots,\\mu_n \\rangle = \\mu_j |\\mu_1,\\ldots,\\mu_j,\\ldots,\\mu_n \\rangle $$\n",

    "$$V_2 = \\exp(H'A) = \\exp(H'\\sum_j s_j s_{j+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the 2D model can be constructed by adding a chain through application of $V_1$ and then define the internal interactions by using $V_2$. So one gets the following chain of operations\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\cdots V_2 V_1 V_2 V_1 V_2 V_1 V_2 V_1 V_2 V_1$$\n",
    "\n",
