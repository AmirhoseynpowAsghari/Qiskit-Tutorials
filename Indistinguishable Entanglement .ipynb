    "\n",
    "The **Schmidt decomposition** is a powerful mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to describe the entanglement in a bipartite quantum system (i.e., a system divided into two subsystems). Given a pure state of two distinguishable subsystems $A$ and $B$, the Schmidt decomposition theorem says that the state can be written as:\n",

    "\n",
    "For fermionic systems, one alternative to the Schmidt decomposition is the **Slater decomposition**. This is a way of expressing the state of a system of fermions in terms of **Slater determinants**.\n",

    "This approach focuses on the occupation number basis, where the state of the system is described in terms of how many particles occupy each mode.
