    "### 1. **Schmidt Decomposition and Its Limitation for Fermions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Schmidt decomposition** is a powerful mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics to describe the entanglement in a bipartite quantum system (i.e., a system divided into two subsystems). Given a pure state of two distinguishable subsystems $A$ and $B$, the Schmidt decomposition theorem says that the state can be written as:\n",

    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i \\lambda_i |a_i\\rangle \\otimes |b_i\\rangle\n",

    "- **Indistinguishability**: Fermions are identical particles, meaning you cannot say which fermion is in which subsystem without violating the principle of indistinguishability.\n",

    "\n",
    "For fermionic systems, one alternative to the Schmidt decomposition is the **Slater decomposition**. This is a way of expressing the state of a system of fermions in terms of **Slater determinants**.\n",

    "This approach focuses on the occupation number basis, where the state of the system is described in terms of how many particles occupy each mode.
